# BEconTermPaper

This repository includes the following files:

1. Python code used to run social network simulations to investigate herding (this is a .py file, so opening it directly runs the file, to actually view the code, open it with VStudio, Jupyter, Spyder etc.)
2. The data generated from the simulations in the form of Excel sheets
3. The R code used to run regressions on the data generated
4. The R code has been separated into Agent Public, Agent Private, Market Public and Market Private based on whether the data pertains to agents or the market, and whether the auction was private value or common value

The files were used in the writing of the term paper for the Behavioural Economics course at the Delhi School of Economics, submitted to Dr. Sourav Sarkar.
